# Morse-Code-Decoder-Project
part b is to test the Arduino built-in led with a toggle button. In this part we are using polling. 
part c is to use an interrupt to achieve the previous function. 
part d is to detect if the user inputs a "." or "-" based on the press time. 
part e is to combine the LED control with the ASCII Morse code translation to build a Morse Code Decoder. The button press produces a red LED flash, which represents a "-," and a white LED flash, which represents a "." In the end, the Arduino will translate the received "-" "." to alphabetical and numerical characters on the serial monitor.
