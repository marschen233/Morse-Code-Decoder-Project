# Morse-Code-Decoder-Project
Part B is to test the Arduino built-in LED with a toggle button. In this part, we are using polling. <br>
Part C is to use an interrupt to achieve the previous function. <br>
Part D is to detect if the user inputs a "." or "-" based on the press time. <br>
Part E is to combine the LED control with the ASCII Morse code translation to build a Morse Code Decoder. The button press produces a red LED flash, which represents a "-," and a white LED flash, which represents a "." In the end, the Arduino will translate the received "-" "." to alphabetical and numerical characters on the serial monitor.
