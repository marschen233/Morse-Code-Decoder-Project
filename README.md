# Morse-Code-Decoder-Project
**1. Part B** is to test the Arduino built-in LED with a toggle button. In this part, we are using polling. [video here](https://youtube.com/shorts/amShUlg6N-8?si=JnKY1JSXmlFZAhjV) <br>
**2. Part C is** to use an interrupt to achieve the previous function. [video here](https://youtu.be/ori23zihdN8?si=OmeLaIc-xLyqmoKe) <br>
**3. Part D** is to detect if the user inputs a "." or "-" based on the press time. [video here](https://youtu.be/xVJ_TVAp6Sc?si=qLUAskjXT-so3clC) <br>
**4. Part E** is to combine the LED control with the ASCII Morse code translation to build a Morse Code Decoder. The button press produces a red LED flash, which represents a "-," and a white LED flash, which represents a "." In the end, the Arduino will translate the received "-" "." to alphabetical and numerical characters on the serial monitor. [video here](https://youtu.be/IR7bV19rmOw?si=6wRkJHPaAx63E3rv)
